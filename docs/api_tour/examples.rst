A collection of examples
========================

This collection of examples is supposed to show the following:

 * how to define individuals and enroll them in a study;
 * how to define markers and collect them into a markers set;
 * how to save genotype data defined on the latter;
 * how to do some basic computations on the latter;
 * how to do basic error handling.

These examples are meant to give an idea on how things work, thus all
the nitty gritty details on how one can make things efficient and
scalable are postponed to documentation in the developer's section. In
other words, what it is shown here is adequate for simple scripts that
are not supposed to do things like loading in one go 20,000
individuals and related information.
