Galaxy based User Interface
===========================

Many of omero/vl operations are accessible, and usable, via galaxy.

Developments details are in the developer manual, here we are mainly
concerned with their usage.

This is the list of the currently available modules.

 * Data import into Omero/VL

   - new individual definitions

   - new biosample definitions
 
   - 

The general strategy for the import should be, I expect, uploading a
file and the invoking the importer.

 * Pre-cooked queries
